                    S 1000 RR  <br>

                    Starting from  <br>
                    ₹ 19,75,000.00 <br>
                    Pro : ₹ 21,65,000 <br>
                    Pro M Sport : ₹ 23,95,000.00  <br>
                    
                    
                    
                    THE BMW S 1000 RR.  <br>
                    THE SUPERBIKE OF SUPERLATIVES.  <br>
                    
                    
                    Always pushing to the limit and in search of the ideal line, you've got 152 kW (207 hp) underneath you.  <br>
                     Unbridled power pushes your RR to the max - with a maximum torque of 113 Nm at 11,000 rpm and a torque curve of at least 100 Nm over a range of 5,500 to 14,500 [rpm].  <br>
                     Ten years after the first generation of the RR first mesmerized the world of motorcycles, we're now entering the next level of performance. <br>
                     We have revised almost every component of the RR - from the front to the rear. The result: less weight and noticeably higher performance. <br>
                      Are you ready for the pole position and for victory? The RR awaits you. <br>
                    
                    
                    
                    Designed for the pole position.  <br>
                    
                    Anyone who looks at it becomes immediately aware: Here stands a high performance motorcycle. Every part of the RR has been designed to get the most out of it.  <br>
                     Take, for instance, the frame layout with its new suspension technology that makes the RR lighter and more precise.  <br>
                     In addition, there is the ergonomically perfect seating position, which is unrivalled thanks to the modified frame and fairing design.  <br>
                     The standard LED headlights give the bike an absolutely dynamic and aggressive look. The front indicators have wandered from the fairing to the rearview mirrors, which not only looks aesthetically pleasing, but it also provides improved visibility. <br>
                      Seen from the rear, the RR dominates in terms of design and functionality: "All-in-one" is the motto here. In addition to number plate lighting, the number plate holder now also includes LED turn signals, tail lights and brake lights. <br>
